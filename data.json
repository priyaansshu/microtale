The teacher first wrote 10 sentences and then as soon as he finished, he started to erase them from board one after another. The kid was still on the 3rd sentence and teacher just wiped the board clean. The kid was waiting for someone to say something but no one uttered a word. Kid sneak a peek into the notebook of other students & was shocked to see they all have already written all the sentences, therefore he tried again next time but still failed..after the 4th try he started crying looking down at his notebook, when teacher suddenly caught him sobbing in the corner. The teacher after the first glance in his notebook asked him one single question \"konsi class mein ho baache?\" and the kid replied \"3rd\" then teacher put his hand on his head and said \"Beta yeh 6th class ke bacchon ki class hai\" and then teacher took him to his drawing class which was the class scheduled for students of his age..",
